## 📦 Deliverables Status

### Required Files ✅

- [x] Public GitHub repository link
- [x] Working Dockerfile
- [x] docker-compose.yml
- [x] CI/CD YAML pipeline file (.github/workflows/ci.yml)
- [x] Screenshots guide (DELIVERABLES.md)
- [x] Documentation & Report (README.md + devops_report.md)

### Screenshots to Capture (See DELIVERABLES.md)

1. ⏳ Passing CI/CD pipeline
2. ⏳ Running containers (docker compose ps)
3. ⏳ Docker Hub deployment proof
4. ⏳ PostgreSQL connection test
5. ⏳ Test coverage report
6. ⏳ Security scan results
7. ⏳ Docker Compose logs
8. ⏳ Pipeline artifacts

**Note:** Screenshots require you to run the pipeline after setting up GitHub secrets.

---

## 🚀 Next Steps (Action Required)

### 1. Configure GitHub Secrets (CRITICAL)

Before the pipeline will work, add these secrets to GitHub:

**Navigate to:** `Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions`

**Add:**
```
DOCKER_USERNAME = your_dockerhub_username
DOCKER_PASSWORD = your_dockerhub_access_token (get from hub.docker.com/settings/security)
CODECOV_TOKEN = your_codecov_token (get from codecov.io)
```

### 2. Test Locally

```powershell
# Verify Docker Compose works
cd c:\Users\hanzl\OneDrive\Desktop\go-postgresql-dev
docker compose up -d
docker compose ps
docker compose logs
docker compose down
```

### 3. Trigger First Pipeline Run

```powershell
# Push to master to trigger pipeline
git add .
git commit -m "ci: initial DevOps implementation complete"
git push origin master
```

### 4. Monitor Pipeline

1. Go to: https://github.com/mrhanzla-lab/go-postgresql-dev/actions
2. Watch the workflow run
3. Verify all 5 stages pass
4. Check Docker Hub for the published image

### 5. Capture Screenshots

Follow the instructions in `DELIVERABLES.md` to capture all 8 required screenshots.
