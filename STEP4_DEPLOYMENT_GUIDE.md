# Step 4 - Cloud/Registry Deployment Setup

## ✅ What Was Implemented

Your CI/CD pipeline now has **complete deployment capabilities** with detailed logging!

## 🔐 Configure Docker Hub Secrets (Required)

To enable Docker Hub deployment, you need to add secrets to your GitHub repository.

### **Step-by-Step:**

#### **1. Create Docker Hub Access Token**

1. Go to: https://hub.docker.com/settings/security
2. Click **"New Access Token"**
3. Name: `github-actions` (or any name)
4. Permissions: **Read, Write, Delete**
5. Click **"Generate"**
6. **Copy the token** (you won't see it again!)

#### **2. Add Secrets to GitHub**

1. Go to: https://github.com/mrhanzla-lab/go-postgresql-dev/settings/secrets/actions
2. Click **"New repository secret"**

**Add these two secrets:**

| Secret Name | Value |
|-------------|-------|
| `DOCKER_USERNAME` | Your Docker Hub username |
| `DOCKER_PASSWORD` | The access token you just created |

**Example:**
```
DOCKER_USERNAME: mrhanzla-lab
DOCKER_PASSWORD: dckr_pat_abc123xyz... (your token)
```

#### **3. Verify Configuration**

After adding secrets, push any commit to master branch:
```powershell
git commit --allow-empty -m "test: trigger deployment"
git push origin master
```

## 🌐 Alternative Deployment Options

The pipeline also suggests alternative platforms:

### **Option 1: Deploy to Render**
Uncomment these lines in `ci.yml`:
```yaml
- name: Deploy to Render
  env:
    RENDER_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.RENDER_API_KEY }}
  run: |
    curl -X POST "https://api.render.com/v1/services/${{ secrets.RENDER_SERVICE_ID }}/deploys" \
      -H "Authorization: Bearer $RENDER_API_KEY" \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

### **Option 2: Deploy to Railway**
Uncomment these lines in `ci.yml`:
```yaml
- name: Deploy to Railway
  env:
    RAILWAY_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.RAILWAY_TOKEN }}
  run: |
    curl -X POST "https://backboard.railway.app/graphql/v2" \
      -H "Authorization: Bearer $RAILWAY_TOKEN" \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -d '{"query":"mutation { deploymentTrigger(projectId: \"${{ secrets.RAILWAY_PROJECT_ID }}\") { id } }"}'
```

## ✅ Step 4 Requirements Met

| Requirement | Status | Evidence |
|-------------|--------|----------|
| **1. Push to Docker Hub using secrets** | ✅ | Docker login with secrets, push on master |
| **2. Alternative deployment options** | ✅ | Render/Railway commented code ready |
| **3. Deployment logs in pipeline** | ✅ | Comprehensive logs in Deploy stage |

---

## 🚀 Test Your Deployment

### **1. Check if secrets are configured**
Pipeline will show:
```
✅ Docker Hub credentials configured
```

### **2. Verify image was pushed**
```powershell
# Check Docker Hub
# Visit: https://hub.docker.com/r/<username>/go-postgresql

# Or pull the image
docker pull <your-username>/go-postgresql:latest
```

### **3. Run the deployed image**
```powershell
docker run -d -p 5432:5432 --name my-postgres <your-username>/go-postgresql:latest
docker ps
docker logs my-postgres
```
